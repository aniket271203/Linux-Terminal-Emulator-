# Linux Terminal Emulator

## Project Description

A Linux Terminal Emulator mimics a traditional command-line interface (CLI) environment, enabling users to interact with the system using text-based commands. It supports running shell scripts, managing files, and accessing various system utilities, providing a powerful tool for developers and system administrators to perform tasks efficiently in a Unix-like environment.

## Features

- Execute shell commands
- Manage files and directories
- Run shell scripts
- Access system utilities
